    """Use MIMIC to find the optimum for a given optimization problem.

    Parameters
    ----------
    problem: optimization object
        Object containing fitness function optimization problem to be solved.
        For example, :code:`DiscreteOpt()` or :code:`TSPOpt()`.
    pop_size: int, default: 200
        Size of population to be used in algorithm.
    keep_pct: float, default: 0.2
        Proportion of samples to keep at each iteration of the algorithm,
        expressed as a value between 0 and 1.
    max_attempts: int, default: 10
        Maximum number of attempts to find a better neighbor at each step.
    max_iters: int, default: np.inf
        Maximum number of iterations of the algorithm.

    Returns
    -------
    best_state: array
        Numpy array containing state that optimizes the fitness function.
    best_fitness: float
        Value of fitness function at best state.
