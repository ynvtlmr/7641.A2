    """Use randomized hill climbing to find the optimum for a given
    optimization problem.

    Parameters
    ----------
    problem: optimization object
        Object containing fitness function optimization problem to be solved.
        For example, :code:`DiscreteOpt()`, :code:`ContinuousOpt()` or
        :code:`TSPOpt()`.
    max_attempts: int, default: 10
        Maximum number of attempts to find a better neighbor at each step.
    max_iters: int, default: np.inf
        Maximum number of iterations of the algorithm.
    restarts: int, default: 0
        Number of random restarts.
    init_state: array, default: None
        1-D Numpy array containing starting state for algorithm.
        If :code:`None`, then a random state is used.

    Returns
    -------
    best_state: array
        Numpy array containing state that optimizes the fitness function.
    best_fitness: float
        Value of fitness function at best state.
